# Sextant — Claude Code plugin

Bundles [Sextant](https://github.com/kylebastien/sextant-mcp) into a
Claude Code session: the MCP server, three skills the agent
auto-loads, three slash commands, and a sample git pre-commit hook
that blocks commits on a dirty grade.

## Install

You need the `sextant` and `sextant-mcp` binaries on `PATH`. Either:

- Install a release build (recommended):
  `brew install kylebastien/sextant/sextant` once the tap exists, or
  download the matching archive from
  <https://github.com/kylebastien/sextant-mcp/releases>.
- Or build from source: `cargo install --path crates/sextant-cli &&
  cargo install --path crates/sextant-mcp` from a checkout.

Then, from a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add kylebastien/sextant-mcp
/plugin install sextant@kylebastien/sextant-mcp
```

The plugin lives at `plugin/` in this repo, so the marketplace is the
repo itself.

## What the plugin does

### MCP server

Registers `sextant-mcp` as an MCP stdio server. Tools surfaced to the
agent: `grade_diff`, `grade_files`, `list_rules`, `explain_rule`,
`get_config`. See the main README for tool semantics.

### Skills (auto-loaded)

- **`sextant-grade`** — when to call `grade_diff` vs `grade_files`,
  how to read the report, severity meanings.
- **`sextant-self-correct`** — the grade → fix → re-grade loop, with
  a 3-pass budget and rules for backing out regressions.
- **`sextant-author-rule`** — frontmatter schema for `.sextant/rules/`,
  evaluator types (regex / llm), validation flow.

Skills are markdown — read them directly under `plugin/skills/`. The
plugin host injects them into the agent's context when their
descriptions match the user's request.

### Slash commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/sextant-grade [paths]` | Grade the working tree (or specified paths) and summarize. |
| `/sextant-init` | Run `sextant init` in the current repo. |
| `/sextant-explain <rule-id>` | Print the markdown body for a rule. |

### Git pre-commit hook

The plugin does **not** wire any Claude Code hooks
(`SessionStart`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`). Earlier versions did — they
produced dead-end loops and pushed feedback into the wrong place. The
right integration point is `git commit`: the rest of the toolchain
already understands the bypass semantics, and the gate runs once per
commit instead of once per keystroke.

The agent still grades on demand via the MCP server (`grade_diff`,
`grade_files`) and the `sextant-grade` / `sextant-self-correct`
skills tell it when. The pre-commit hook catches anything the agent
(or you) missed.

A sample script lives at `plugin/hooks/pre-commit.sh`. It runs:

```bash
sextant grade --diff --working-tree --no-llm --fail-on warn
```

…and exits non-zero on any warn or error, so `git commit` aborts when
the gate fires.

**Install (symlink from the plugin checkout):**

```bash
ln -sf ../../plugin/hooks/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

…or copy it if you'd rather not depend on the symlink:

```bash
cp plugin/hooks/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

**Install via [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/):**

```bash
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit \
  "sextant grade --diff --working-tree --no-llm --fail-on warn"
```

**Install via the [pre-commit framework](https://pre-commit.com):**

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: sextant
        name: sextant
        entry: sextant grade --diff --working-tree --no-llm --fail-on warn
        language: system
        pass_filenames: false
```

**Tuning:**

- `--fail-on error` — only `error`-severity findings block; warns are
  advisory.
- `--fail-on never` — hook prints findings but never blocks. Useful
  while calibrating new rules.
- Drop `--no-llm` to include LLM-evaluated rules (slower, needs API
  keys).
- `SEXTANT_SKIP_PRECOMMIT=1` short-circuits the script to a no-op when
  you need to bypass it for a session.
- `git commit --no-verify` is the per-commit escape hatch — use
  sparingly.

## Authoring

Skills live at `plugin/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, commands at
`plugin/commands/<name>.md`, the pre-commit script at
`plugin/hooks/pre-commit.sh`. Each is plain markdown or bash — no
compile step. After editing skills or commands, reload the plugin
(`/plugin reload sextant`) or restart the session.

See `plugin/skills/sextant-author-rule/SKILL.md` for the rule-file
schema.

## Troubleshooting

**"sextant: command not found" when committing.** Your shell `PATH`
doesn't include the install dir. Either install sextant to a
directory already on `PATH` (`~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) or add
the install dir to your shell rc so commits launched from `git`
inherit it.

**`HEAD~1` errors on a fresh repo.** The diff grade needs a base
commit. The first commit of a repo has no `HEAD~1`; Sextant returns
a friendly "no default base" error and the hook exits silently.

**Pre-commit hook blocked the commit and I need to land something
dirty.** Bypass once with `git commit --no-verify`, or disable the
hook for a session with `SEXTANT_SKIP_PRECOMMIT=1`. Calibrate the
rules so the gate fires only on things you actually want blocked.
